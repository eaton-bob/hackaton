## Hackathon Format

The hackathon is a unique opportunity to learn advanced ZeroMQ skills from the experts. It follows the model developed by Pieter Hintjens for many ZeroMQ workshops.

Each year we take a theme and work towards that using an organic contract-driven process.

The theme for 2016 is (to be selected)

 * reliable SERVICE pattern for malamute
 * malamute client model and generator
 * malamute clients + web server integration
 * ...


    Your favorite language binding (e.g. CZMQ if you are working in C)
    Zyre
    Malamute
    zproto
    zproject

And/or implementations in various languages. We drive the hackathon with simple RFCs, pull requests, and a collection of projects that talk together. This is the same process we use in the ZeroMQ community.

## Requirements for Participants

The more you already know about ZeroMQ the better. If you are a full beginner you will have to tag along with others for a while.

Bring your laptop, with ZeroMQ installed and working in your favorite language.


## Schedule

Main event is from 9am to 6pm, participants are welcome to arrive earlier and leave at any time up to midnight. An access code will be provided. Refreshments and snacks will be provided.
