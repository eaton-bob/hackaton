# EEIC ZeroMQ workshop

## Location and schedule

    Eaton European Innovation Center
    Bořivojova 2380, 252 63 Roztoky, Česká Republika

 * 1st day - 5 December 2016 (Monday)
 * 2nd day - 6 December 2016 (Tuesday)
 * 3rd day - 7 December 2016 (Wednesday)

## How to get here
 * Public transport: Use bus line 340 or 350 from station Dejvická in Prague to bus stop Rozcesti Žalov in Roztoky. Note that this is an out-of-city route, you'd need a 40Kc ticket (valid for 2 hours as a bonus).
 * For fans of tracking: You can walk up from the Roztoky-Žalov train station - this is approximately an 80-meter rise over a kilometer-long walk, and it would take you about 15 minutes to get here from the train. Showers are available in our building ;) For the trip you would take the S4 train line leaving Prague from Masarykovo Nadrazi directed to Kralupy or Usti nad Labem, passing Nadrazi Podbaba a couple of kilometers from the Dejvicka bus stops, the line goes every hour or 30 minutes in peak times (or even more often early in the mornings).
 
## Registration and Cost

**Entry is free. Seats are limited, so first come - first served.**

To register, just write an email to <MichalVyskocil@Eaton.com> with a subject `WORKSHOP`.

## Workshop Format

The workshop is a unique opportunity to learn ZeroMQ skills. It follows the model developed by Pieter Hintjens for many ZeroMQ workshops.

Each year we take a theme and work towards that using an organic contract-driven process.

The theme for 2016 is (to be selected):

    Reliable SERVICE pattern for malamute

## Requirements for Participants

You should pre-install (preferably compile from Git heads of respective projects at https://github.com/zeromq):

    ZeroMQ itself: https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq
    Your favorite language binding for ZeroMQ: e.g. https://github.com/zeromq/czmq if you are working in C
    Zyre: https://github.com/zeromq/zyre
    Malamute: https://github.com/zeromq/malamute
    zproto: https://github.com/zeromq/zproto
    zproject: https://github.com/zeromq/zproject
    imatix GSL: https://github.com/imatix/gsl

...and/or implementations in various languages.

You would also need the common opensource development suite of compiler (we use GCC 4.8+), make (we use GNU make), the GNU autotools/automake/autoconf/m4 stack, (optionally) asciidoc to build manpages, etc. If you compile the Git heads above by yourself, you'd probably have the needed toolkits on your system by now :-)

We drive the hackathon with simple RFCs to set up "contracts" for protocols and interaction of components, pull requests, and a collection of projects that talk together. This is the same process we use in the ZeroMQ community. Be morally prepared to not "own" the bits of code, and for the training projects to evolve rapidly and perhaps not in the direction you intended when committing just a minute ago ;)

The more you already know about ZeroMQ and related projects in its ecosystem -- the better. If you are a full beginner, you will have to tag along with others for a while.

Bring your laptop, with ZeroMQ installed and working in your favorite language.
