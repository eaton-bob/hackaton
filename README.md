## Hackathon Format

The hackathon is a unique opportunity to learn advanced ZeroMQ skills from the experts. It follows the model developed by Pieter Hintjens for many ZeroMQ workshops.

Each year we take a theme and work towards that using an organic contract-driven process.

The theme for 2016 is (to be selected)

 * reliable SERVICE pattern for malamute
 * malamute client model and generator
 * malamute clients + web server integration
 * ...

## Requirements for Participants

    Your favorite language binding (e.g. CZMQ if you are working in C)
    Zyre
    Malamute
    zproto
    zproject

And/or implementations in various languages. We drive the hackathon with simple RFCs, pull requests, and a collection of projects that talk together. This is the same process we use in the ZeroMQ community.

The more you already know about ZeroMQ the better. If you are a full beginner you will have to tag along with others for a while.

Bring your laptop, with ZeroMQ installed and working in your favorite language.
